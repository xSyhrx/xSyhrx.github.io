        <h1>OpenGL Rendering Engine</h1>
        <p>
          In this project, I built an OpenGL rendering engine to demonstrate key 3D graphics techniques. The engine features 
          realistic global and point lighting, mesh rendering with textures, cubemaps for environments and reflections, and matrix 
          transformations for scaling, rotation, and positioning. Each section below showcases the specific techniques I used to 
          implement these features in my engine.

        <h2>Global and Point Lighting</h2>
        <p>
          To implement global and point lighting, I utilized OpenGL's lighting system. For global lighting, I set up an ambient 
          light that affects the entire scene, providing a base level of illumination. For point lighting, I created a light source 
          that behaves like a real-world light bulb, emitting light in all directions from a specific position. I applied attenuation 
          to simulate how light diminishes with distance, which helped create realistic shadows and highlights in the scene.

        <h2>Cubemaps</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing cubemaps involved using a set of six textures to represent the faces of a cube. I loaded these textures 
          as cube maps and applied them to simulate environments like skies or reflections. I also learned how to correctly map 
          the camera's view onto the cube to simulate realistic environmental effects, such as skyboxes and reflective surfaces 
          on objects. The process included setting up shaders to sample from the cubemap, allowing me to create dynamic, 
          immersive environments in my 3D scene.

        <h2>Matrix Transformations: Scaling, Rotation, and Position</h2>
        <p>
          Matrix transformations are crucial for controlling the position, orientation, and size of objects in 3D space. I used 
          transformation matrices to apply scaling, rotation, and translation to 3D models. By multiplying these matrices together, 
          I was able to efficiently move, rotate, and scale objects in my scene. This system made it easier to manipulate objects 
          in real time and ensured that all transformations were applied in a consistent manner across different objects and scenes.

    <h2>Particle System: Billboarded Planes</h2>
    <p>
      I implemented a simple yet efficient particle system using billboarded planes. Each particle is represented 
      as a 2D plane that always faces the camera, creating the illusion of 3D particles like fire, smoke, and sparks. I used OpenGL 
      to generate and animate these planes, applying basic transformations like position, velocity, and scale. The planes are rendered 
      with transparent textures, which allows for the creation of realistic effects such as soft particle edges and fading over time. 
      This method is computationally efficient and allowed me to simulate complex particle systems while maintaining high performance 
      in real-time rendering.
