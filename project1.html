        <h2>Ghost Camera Mechanic</h2>
        <p>
          At the heart of my project is the innovative Ghost Camera mechanic. Players take on the role of a photographer who, armed with an old analog camera, explores a haunted mansion. The unique feature of this mechanic is the camera’s ability to reveal hidden entities—ghosts—through its lens, which are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. This is achieved using advanced rendering techniques and custom graphic buffers in Unreal Engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the player uses the camera, the ghosts are rendered onto a separate graphic buffer, isolating them from the rest of the world. This allows me to apply post-processing effects exclusively to the ghost. The transparency effect applied to the ghost subtly blends it back into the world, creating a translucent, ethereal look as it hovers over the environment. The result is an eerie, atmospheric visual effect that immerses the player in the haunting atmosphere of the mansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This mechanic opens up exciting gameplay possibilities, as the player must use their camera to uncover hidden clues, solve puzzles, and track down ghosts in order to progress through the game. The blending of the ghost’s visibility with its surroundings creates a dynamic and engaging mechanic that enhances both the gameplay experience and the storytelling.

        <h2>Storing Ghosts On Separate Graphic Buffers</h2>
        <p>
          To make the AI agents' movements realistic and dynamic, I incorporated steering behaviors. These behaviors, including seek, flee, and wander, enabled the AI agents to interact with their surroundings convincingly. By integrating these behaviors into my project, I added an extra layer of sophistication and realism.

        <h2>Blending Multiple Captures to Make One</h2>
        <p>
          Managing the AI agents' decision-making processes was achieved through a well-structured finite state machine. The FSM architecture allowed me to define distinct states and seamlessly transition between them based on various criteria. This enhanced the control and adaptability of the AI agents while making the project's codebase more modular and maintainable.
